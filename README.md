# ACT/SAT Analyis for 2017 & 2018

## Problem Statement
  Since its inception in 1926, the SAT test has been synonymous with the United States college admissions process. It was the first of its kind, designed to measure intelligence and logical reasoning skills in high school students. Then in 1959 a new test, the ACT, was introduced, combining these conditions with questions containing curriculuum-related academic material. Despite initial doubt, the ACT has gained considerable traction in the past few decades, now overshadowing its predecessor in terms of student participation.
  
  Given datasets on 2017 & 2018 scores and participation rates for all US states (and the District of Columbia) on both these tests, my goal is to assess the differences and correlations between state performance and various factors, including declining participation in the SAT and a rising popularity in the ACT, particularly in certain states.
  
  As a student who had the opportunity to prep and take both test, the goal of my research was to identify any interesting and potentially valuable trends and offer recommendations for a path moving forward that will improve participation and performance for all college-hopeful high schoolers.

  ## Executive Summary
  
 Given the 2017 and 2018 data sets, my first step was to clean and merge the data. I combined all the datasets into an easily readable table and created a consistency across datatypes, allowing me to perform the necessary functions.
  
An important part of figuring out what I was looking for was sorting each tests' data by participation rates, then isolating those states with participation rates either on the highest or lowest end. I utilized different visuals (as can be seen in my code notebook) for clearer understanding. I compared these across both tests, and factored in scores.
    
Performing a statistical summary on my dataset, I identified where performance in states and regions was compared to the national average. This allowed me to single out states whose trends I found most interesting, and eventually zero in on one, about which I speak in length in my slides: Arkansas.
    
As a state with 100% participation in the ACT for both years and only 3% SAT participation in 2017 (and 4% in 2018) my expectation was that Arkansas' students' performance would be considerably well, or at least on par with that of the national ACT average, and lacking when it came to SAT national averages. This was a hasty assumption, as my analyis showed the exact opposite: Despite low participation in the SAT, those few students who opted for the SAT outperformed the average United States scholar.
    
In a state where the ACT is required, the skewed participation is expected. However, sing outside data on both testing and the state of Arkansas itself, I uncovered a possible financial motive as explanation.
 
  ## Conclusion and Recommendations
  * A good first step would be implementing SAT and ACT prep courses throughout different counties in Arkansas, funded in part by The College Board
* This would give a wider community access to generally expensive preparation, boosting scores
* Another step is to more closely analyze the link between socioeconomic status and these standardized tests
* In the long term, perhaps those at the Board may reevaluate the necessity of SAT and ACT testing in college admissions
Redefining the rubric of what a ‘good candidate’ looks like could give back opportunity to students, a suggestion once echoed by the VP of UArkansasfor Medical Studies
